# designobjekt.se website

## About
This is the WordPress theme running on [designobjekt.se][1]. Created as a side project by [AAFF][2] and [1910][3] - the site works as a one page link repository, with automatic item positioning depending on image ratio. Apart from the regular WordPress extensions, there is a lot going on in the JS in regards to transitions and image resizing. Just dive in and take a look.

Everything is bundled with grunt, even the theme php files, in order to keep the src and dist folders separate.

Feel free to copy, edit, update, and use in any way, but please give credit where it is due. Happy tinkering!
